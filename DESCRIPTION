Description: The Reproducible Open Coding Kit ('ROCK', and this package, 'rock')
  was developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
  geared towards qualitative research methods. It was developed to be both
  human- and machine-readable, in the spirit of MarkDown and 'YAML'. The idea is
  that this makes it relatively easy to write other functions and packages
  to process 'ROCK' files. The 'rock' package contains functions for basic
  coding and analysis, such as collecting and showing coded fragments and
  prettifying sources, as well as a number of advanced analyses such as the
  Qualitative Network Approach and Qualitative/Unified Exploration of State
  Transitions. The 'ROCK' and this 'rock' package are described in the ROCK
  book (Zörgő & Peters, 2022; <https://rockbook.org>), in Zörgő & Peters
  (2024) <doi:10.1080/21642850.2022.2119144> and Peters, Zörgő and van der
  Maas (2022) <doi:10.31234/osf.io/cvf52>, and more information and
  tutorials are available at <https://rock.science>.
