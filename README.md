The Reproducible Open Coding Kit (â€˜ROCKâ€™, and this package, â€˜rockâ€™) was
developed to facilitate reproducible and open coding, specifically
geared towards qualitative research methods. It was developed to be both
human- and machine-readable, in the spirit of MarkDown and â€˜YAMLâ€™. The
idea is that this makes it relatively easy to write other functions and
packages to process â€˜ROCKâ€™ files. The â€˜rockâ€™ package contains functions
for basic coding and analysis, such as collecting and showing coded
fragments and prettifying sources, as well as a number of advanced
analyses such as the Qualitative Network Approach and
Qualitative/Unified Exploration of State Transitions. The â€˜ROCKâ€™ and
this â€˜rockâ€™ package are described in the ROCK book (ZÃ¶rgÅ‘ & Peters,
2022; <https://rockbook.org>, in ZÃ¶rgÅ‘ & Peters (2024;
[doi.org/jrfb](https://doi.org/10.1080/21642850.2022.2119144)), and
Peters, ZÃ¶rgÅ‘ and van der Maas (2022;
[doi.org/hwzj](https://doi.org/10.31234/OSF.IO/CVF52)), and more
information and tutorials are available at <https://rock.science>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `rock` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('rock');
```

You can install the development version of `rock` from
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) with:

``` r
remotes::install_git('https://codeberg.org/r-packages/rock');
```

(assuming you have `remotes` installed; otherwise, install that first
using the `install.packages()` function)
