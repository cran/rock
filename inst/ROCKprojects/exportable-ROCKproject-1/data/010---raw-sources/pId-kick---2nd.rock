[[uid=7xj02rg0]] Self-efficacy is a construct that
[[uid=7xj02rg1]] describes one’s confidence in their own
[[uid=7xj02rg2]] ability to successfully control daily
[[uid=7xj02rg3]] life challenges. Confidence in this
[[uid=7xj02rg4]] context reflects a personal value that
[[uid=7xj02rg5]] seems to contribute to a positive
[[uid=7xj02rg6]] perception of both beneficial and
[[uid=7xj02rg7]] potentially detrimental experiences.
[[uid=7xj02rg8]] 
[[uid=7xj02rg9]] Self-efficacy seems to be distinctive
[[uid=7xj02rgb]] from other constructs because it does
[[uid=7xj02rgc]] not focus AND is not (entirely)
[[uid=7xj02rgd]] dependent on the outcome (e.g. achieve
[[uid=7xj02rgf]] goals, feel confident). Although the
[[uid=7xj02rgg]] experience of self-efficacy may be
[[uid=7xj02rgh]] influenced by such outcomes,
[[uid=7xj02rgj]] self-efficacy seems to be more related
[[uid=7xj02rgk]] to one’s norms and values than to a
[[uid=7xj02rgl]] specific end-state.
[[uid=7xj02rgm]] 
[[uid=7xj02rgn]] I believe self-efficacy may be
[[uid=7xj02rgp]] influenced by prior experiences in
[[uid=7xj02rgq]] which one was able to adapt to daily
[[uid=7xj02rgr]] life challenges (or not). Furthermore,
[[uid=7xj02rgs]] it will likely depend on the
[[uid=7xj02rgt]] perceptions one focuses on whether one
[[uid=7xj02rgw]] will experience low or high
[[uid=7xj02rgx]] self-efficacy. For instance, if you
[[uid=7xj02rgy]] have a job interview and it goes
[[uid=7xj02rgz]] terribly wrong because you applied for
[[uid=7xj02rh0]] a job that you don’t qualify for, you
[[uid=7xj02rh1]] may experience this as a negative
[[uid=7xj02rh2]] outcome. However, if you still feel you
[[uid=7xj02rh3]] are a capable professional, you might
[[uid=7xj02rh4]] integrate this experience in the jobs
[[uid=7xj02rh5]] you apply for in the future. In the
[[uid=7xj02rh6]] first example, the job interview may
[[uid=7xj02rh7]] result in lower self-efficacy. In the
[[uid=7xj02rh8]] second example it probably does not
[[uid=7xj02rh9]] impact one’s self-efficacy.
