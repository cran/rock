[[uid=7xccs3x8]] Cognitive Restructuring
[[uid=7xccs3x9]] 
[[uid=7xccs3xb]] [[taskId=definition]]
[[uid=7xccs3xc]] 
[[uid=7xccs3xd]] Cognitive restructuring refers to the
[[uid=7xccs3xf]] identification and modification of
[[uid=7xccs3xg]] individuals’ existing thoughts and the
[[uid=7xccs3xh]] beliefs associated with those thoughts.
[[uid=7xccs3xj]] This process involves transforming a
[[uid=7xccs3xk]] person's thoughts, interpretations, and
[[uid=7xccs3xl]] perceptions about the world,
[[uid=7xccs3xm]] themselves, and others into more
[[uid=7xccs3xn]] positive and functional ones.
[[uid=7xccs3xp]] Particularly within the context of
[[uid=7xccs3xq]] Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),
[[uid=7xccs3xr]] cognitive restructuring involves
[[uid=7xccs3xs]] identifying the individual's first
[[uid=7xccs3xt]] thoughts -known as automatic thoughts-
[[uid=7xccs3xw]] that arise when an event occurs,
[[uid=7xccs3xx]] questioning these thoughts, and
[[uid=7xccs3xy]] replacing them with more positive
[[uid=7xccs3xz]] alternatives. Since thoughts are
[[uid=7xccs3y0]] closely linked to emotions and
[[uid=7xccs3y1]] behaviors, cognitive restructuring
[[uid=7xccs3y2]] facilitates a more positive
[[uid=7xccs3y3]] reorganization of not only the
[[uid=7xccs3y4]] individual’s thoughts but also their
[[uid=7xccs3y5]] emotional responses and behaviors. In
[[uid=7xccs3y6]] other words, cognitive restructuring
[[uid=7xccs3y7]] can be described as a multifaceted
[[uid=7xccs3y8]] construct that encompasses emotions and
[[uid=7xccs3y9]] behavioral reactions. Cognitive
[[uid=7xccs3yb]] restructuring is related to an
[[uid=7xccs3yc]] individual's memory, emotions,
[[uid=7xccs3yd]] perception, attention, and judgment
[[uid=7xccs3yf]] processes. To restructure a person's
[[uid=7xccs3yg]] thoughts, it may be necessary to
[[uid=7xccs3yh]] retrieve various events stored in their
[[uid=7xccs3yj]] memory. The individual's perspective on
[[uid=7xccs3yk]] these events, specifically their
[[uid=7xccs3yl]] perception at a given moment, is
[[uid=7xccs3ym]] examined. Attention is focused on which
[[uid=7xccs3yn]] aspects of these events the individual
[[uid=7xccs3yp]] particularly notices. Additionally,
[[uid=7xccs3yq]] when assessing the accuracy or realism
[[uid=7xccs3yr]] of the individual's thoughts, the
[[uid=7xccs3ys]] judgment processes are also addressed.
[[uid=7xccs3yt]] Furthermore, when a person’s thoughts
[[uid=7xccs3yw]] are restructured and replaced with more
[[uid=7xccs3yx]] positive alternatives, it can lead to
[[uid=7xccs3yy]] positive effects on their emotions and
[[uid=7xccs3yz]] behaviors.
[[uid=7xccs3z0]] 
[[uid=7xccs3z1]] Although cognitive restructuring is
[[uid=7xccs3z2]] closely related to thoughts, emotions,
[[uid=7xccs3z3]] and behaviors, it may not encompass the
[[uid=7xccs3z4]] individual's personality, social
[[uid=7xccs3z5]] environment, emotion regulation skills,
[[uid=7xccs3z6]] and environmental or cultural factors.
[[uid=7xccs3z7]] Factors such as the individual's
[[uid=7xccs3z8]] surroundings, the culture in which they
[[uid=7xccs3z9]] were raised, and the emotion regulation
[[uid=7xccs3zb]] skills acquired from childhood can
[[uid=7xccs3zc]] significantly influence the shaping of
[[uid=7xccs3zd]] a person's thoughts. Cognitive
[[uid=7xccs3zf]] restructuring may not address these
[[uid=7xccs3zg]] aspects directly, instead focusing
[[uid=7xccs3zh]] primarily on the individual's core
[[uid=7xccs3zj]] beliefs and the automatic thoughts that
[[uid=7xccs3zk]] arise in connection with them.
[[uid=7xccs3zl]] Additionally, in the cognitive
[[uid=7xccs3zm]] restructuring process, traumatic
[[uid=7xccs3zn]] experiences from the individual's past
[[uid=7xccs3zp]] are similarly not addressed directly;
[[uid=7xccs3zq]] rather, the focus is on how these
[[uid=7xccs3zr]] traumatic experiences currently affect
[[uid=7xccs3zs]] the person's thoughts and perceptions.
[[uid=7xccs3zt]] 
[[uid=7xccs3zw]] While cognitive restructuring shares
[[uid=7xccs3zx]] similarities with some cognitive
[[uid=7xccs3zy]] processes, there are many points of
[[uid=7xccs3zz]] differentiation. For instance, the
[[uid=7xccs400]] emotion regulation process is related
[[uid=7xccs401]] to an individual's ability to manage
[[uid=7xccs402]] their emotions in response to an
[[uid=7xccs403]] emotional stimulus, while cognitive
[[uid=7xccs404]] restructuring addresses the person's
[[uid=7xccs405]] core beliefs and the automatic thoughts
[[uid=7xccs406]] that arise in connection with them,
[[uid=7xccs407]] thereby having a more positive impact
[[uid=7xccs408]] on the individual's emotions.
[[uid=7xccs409]] Additionally, another cognitive aspect,
[[uid=7xccs40b]] critical thinking, is related to the
[[uid=7xccs40c]] individual's process of questioning,
[[uid=7xccs40d]] perceiving, and evaluating their
[[uid=7xccs40f]] thoughts. In contrast, cognitive
[[uid=7xccs40g]] restructuring is distinguished from
[[uid=7xccs40h]] critical thinking by its focus on the
[[uid=7xccs40j]] process of replacing negative thoughts
[[uid=7xccs40k]] with more functional ones.
