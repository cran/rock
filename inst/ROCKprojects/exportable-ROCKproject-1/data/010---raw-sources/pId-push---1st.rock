[[uid=7xccqw08]] Attitude.
[[uid=7xccqw09]] 
[[uid=7xccqw0b]] [[taskId=definition]]
[[uid=7xccqw0c]] 
[[uid=7xccqw0d]] Attitude is a complex construct shaped
[[uid=7xccqw0f]] by cognitive, emotional, and personal
[[uid=7xccqw0g]] characteristics, influenced by past
[[uid=7xccqw0h]] experiences, cultural background, and
[[uid=7xccqw0j]] media exposure. Cognitively, attitudes
[[uid=7xccqw0k]] are formed and reinforced by our
[[uid=7xccqw0l]] experiences, societal norms, and media
[[uid=7xccqw0m]] portrayals, which shape our
[[uid=7xccqw0n]] perspectives on various topics, such as
[[uid=7xccqw0p]] gender roles, body image, and
[[uid=7xccqw0q]] relationships. Emotionally, attitudes
[[uid=7xccqw0r]] play a crucial role in shaping our
[[uid=7xccqw0s]] emotional responses; for instance, a
[[uid=7xccqw0t]] belief in personal control can help us
[[uid=7xccqw0w]] regulate emotions and maintain
[[uid=7xccqw0x]] resilience in the face of setbacks.
[[uid=7xccqw0y]] Additionally, personal characteristics,
[[uid=7xccqw0z]] including traits from the Big Five
[[uid=7xccqw10]] personality model, temperament, and
[[uid=7xccqw11]] individual insights, contribute to the
[[uid=7xccqw12]] formation and adaptation of attitudes.
[[uid=7xccqw13]] These traits determine how we approach
[[uid=7xccqw14]] new experiences, manage our careers,
[[uid=7xccqw15]] interact with others, and respond to
[[uid=7xccqw16]] challenges, with temperament reflecting
[[uid=7xccqw17]] innate predispositions and therapy
[[uid=7xccqw18]] offering the potential to reshape
[[uid=7xccqw19]] attitudes through increased
[[uid=7xccqw1b]] self-awareness and cognitive
[[uid=7xccqw1c]] restructuring.
[[uid=7xccqw1d]] 
[[uid=7xccqw1f]] Cognitive Aspects
[[uid=7xccqw1g]] 
[[uid=7xccqw1h]] • Past Experience: Dating with an LGBT
[[uid=7xccqw1j]] activist can change attitudes towards
[[uid=7xccqw1k]] homosexuality.
[[uid=7xccqw1l]] 
[[uid=7xccqw1m]] • Cultural Background: Conservative
[[uid=7xccqw1n]] families have attitudes towards
[[uid=7xccqw1p]] strictly forbidden sexuality before
[[uid=7xccqw1q]] marriage.
[[uid=7xccqw1r]] 
[[uid=7xccqw1s]] • Media Influence: Generation Z women
[[uid=7xccqw1t]] have attitudes on more idealized body
[[uid=7xccqw1w]] shape or making a career as an
[[uid=7xccqw1x]] influencer.
[[uid=7xccqw1y]] 
[[uid=7xccqw1z]] Emotional Aspects
[[uid=7xccqw20]] 
[[uid=7xccqw21]] • Initial Reactions: When a fresh
[[uid=7xccqw22]] graduate find a job that is very
[[uid=7xccqw23]] stressful, he/she can develop a
[[uid=7xccqw24]] negative attitude towards the job
[[uid=7xccqw25]] afterwards.
[[uid=7xccqw26]] 
[[uid=7xccqw27]] • Emotional Associations: If a person
[[uid=7xccqw28]] always feels happy when listening to a
[[uid=7xccqw29]] specific genre of music that may
[[uid=7xccqw2b]] trigger positive memories with family,
[[uid=7xccqw2c]] then she/he may develop a positive
[[uid=7xccqw2d]] attitude toward that genre.
[[uid=7xccqw2f]] 
[[uid=7xccqw2g]] Personal Characteristics Aspects
[[uid=7xccqw2h]] 
[[uid=7xccqw2j]] • Openness to Experience: A person can
[[uid=7xccqw2k]] have a curious or cautious attitude
[[uid=7xccqw2l]] towards life experiences.
[[uid=7xccqw2m]] 
[[uid=7xccqw2n]] • Conscientiousness: A person can have
[[uid=7xccqw2p]] an organized or careless attitude
[[uid=7xccqw2q]] towards their career.
[[uid=7xccqw2r]] 
[[uid=7xccqw2s]] • Extraversion: A person might have an
[[uid=7xccqw2t]] outgoing or reserved attitude towards
[[uid=7xccqw2w]] foreigners.
[[uid=7xccqw2x]] 
[[uid=7xccqw2y]] • Agreeableness: A person might have a
[[uid=7xccqw2z]] compassionate or judgmental attitude
[[uid=7xccqw30]] towards social relationships.
[[uid=7xccqw31]] 
[[uid=7xccqw32]] • Neuroticism: A person might have
[[uid=7xccqw33]] nervous or resilient attitudes towards
[[uid=7xccqw34]] challenges.
[[uid=7xccqw35]] 
[[uid=7xccqw36]] • Temperament: A person with a
[[uid=7xccqw37]] naturally calm temperament may have a
[[uid=7xccqw38]] more relaxed attitude towards stressful
[[uid=7xccqw39]] situations, while someone with a more
[[uid=7xccqw3b]] anxious temperament may develop a
[[uid=7xccqw3c]] cautious or worried attitude in similar
[[uid=7xccqw3d]] scenarios.
[[uid=7xccqw3f]] 
[[uid=7xccqw3g]] • Insight: Through therapy, a person
[[uid=7xccqw3h]] might realize that their negative
[[uid=7xccqw3j]] attitude towards social interactions
[[uid=7xccqw3k]] stems from cognitive distortions, such
[[uid=7xccqw3l]] as overgeneralizing based on a few bad
[[uid=7xccqw3m]] experiences. By gaining insight and
[[uid=7xccqw3n]] challenging these distortions, they can
[[uid=7xccqw3p]] develop a more positive and balanced
[[uid=7xccqw3q]] attitude towards socializing.
[[uid=7xccqw3r]] 
[[uid=7xccqw3s]] • Locus of Control: If someone has an
[[uid=7xccqw3t]] attitude towards achievement as working
[[uid=7xccqw3w]] hard and gaining success, they might
[[uid=7xccqw3x]] view failing an exam as an opportunity
[[uid=7xccqw3y]] to learn from mistakes and improve.
[[uid=7xccqw3z]] 
[[uid=7xccqw40]] Differences
[[uid=7xccqw41]] 
[[uid=7xccqw42]] • Personality: Personality consists of
[[uid=7xccqw43]] characteristics and traits that can
[[uid=7xccqw44]] develop over time, remain stable, and
[[uid=7xccqw45]] are shaped by both genetics and the
[[uid=7xccqw46]] environment. In contrast, attitudes
[[uid=7xccqw47]] toward specific objects can change over
[[uid=7xccqw48]] time in different contexts and are
[[uid=7xccqw49]] often more influenced by environmental
[[uid=7xccqw4b]] factors.
[[uid=7xccqw4c]] 
[[uid=7xccqw4d]] • Emotion: Emotions are intense and
[[uid=7xccqw4f]] quick feelings that arise in reaction
[[uid=7xccqw4g]] to specific contexts, whereas attitudes
[[uid=7xccqw4h]] are more cognitively based ideas and
[[uid=7xccqw4j]] thoughts toward contexts that tend to
[[uid=7xccqw4k]] remain longer and are broader in scope.
[[uid=7xccqw4l]] Attitudes can change the way we feel
[[uid=7xccqw4m]] towards specific situations.
