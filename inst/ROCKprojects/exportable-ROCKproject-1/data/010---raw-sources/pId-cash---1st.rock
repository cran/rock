[[uid=7x3383kg]] This is the process* of rather positive
[[uid=7x3383kh]] evaluation of one's person in response
[[uid=7x3383kj]] to internal and external stimuli. It is
[[uid=7x3383kk]] a multifaceted construct relating to
[[uid=7x3383kl]] cognitive, emotional, and behavioral
[[uid=7x3383km]] aspects. It is distinguished from
[[uid=7x3383kn]] similar constructs (such as
[[uid=7x3383kp]] self-esteem, optimism, self-efficacy,
[[uid=7x3383kq]] narcissism) in that it relates to the
[[uid=7x3383kr]] regulation of the individual's
[[uid=7x3383ks]] relationship with the environment
[[uid=7x3383kt]] (reflects the individual's response to
[[uid=7x3383kw]] the environment; perception of
[[uid=7x3383kx]] situations to induce/maintain a
[[uid=7x3383ky]] positive evaluation of oneself). This
[[uid=7x3383kz]] construct involves the processes of
[[uid=7x3383l0]] perception, attention, memory, and
[[uid=7x3383l1]] judgment.Â

[[uid=7x3383l3]] *I define a construct as a certain
[[uid=7x3383l4]] process, although my first thought when
[[uid=7x3383l5]] I read the items tested is to associate
[[uid=7x3383l6]] that it is a trait (and if it is a
[[uid=7x3383l7]] trait, it can also have its counterpart
[[uid=7x3383l8]] in a state).
