[[uid=7xccn7gw]] 
[[uid=7xccn7gx]] [[taskId=label]]
[[uid=7xccn7gy]] 
[[uid=7xccn7gz]] I do not recognize this as a construct
[[uid=7xccn7h0]] 
[[uid=7xccn7h1]] [[taskId=definition]]
[[uid=7xccn7h2]] 
[[uid=7xccn7h3]] I’m confused by the definition given
[[uid=7xccn7h4]] and it does not bring to mind an
[[uid=7xccn7h5]] obvious construct for me.
[[uid=7xccn7h6]] 
[[uid=7xccn7h7]] “[…]” in the second part of the
[[uid=7xccn7h8]] sentence appears to relate to something
[[uid=7xccn7h9]] like resilience. Resilience is about
[[uid=7xccn7hb]] one’s ability to manage challenging or
[[uid=7xccn7hc]] stressful situations or setbacks
[[uid=7xccn7hd]] without significant disruption or
[[uid=7xccn7hf]] emotional impact. It can also refer to
[[uid=7xccn7hg]] a rapid bouncing back and/or growth in
[[uid=7xccn7hh]] the face of adversity. It might refer
[[uid=7xccn7hj]] to stability or successful emotional
[[uid=7xccn7hk]] regulation.  Being ‘thick skinned’ does
[[uid=7xccn7hl]] not quite fit with my understanding of
[[uid=7xccn7hm]] resilience although there is some link.
[[uid=7xccn7hn]] I see ‘thick skinned’ as an idiom that
[[uid=7xccn7hp]] perhaps has slightly different meanings
[[uid=7xccn7hq]] in different languages or cultures. I
[[uid=7xccn7hr]] associate it with being unreactive to
[[uid=7xccn7hs]] criticism or insult or things others
[[uid=7xccn7ht]] say or do, rather than being able to
[[uid=7xccn7hw]] weather difficult situations without
[[uid=7xccn7hx]] substantial emotional impact.
[[uid=7xccn7hy]] 
[[uid=7xccn7hz]] […] in the first part of the sentence
[[uid=7xccn7j0]] seems to be saying that the construct
[[uid=7xccn7j1]] is a precusor or necessary factor for
[[uid=7xccn7j2]] self-efficacy.  Self-efficacy is about
[[uid=7xccn7j3]] belief in one’s ability to complete a
[[uid=7xccn7j4]] task or manage a situation or
[[uid=7xccn7j5]] challenge.  The reference to ‘capacity
[[uid=7xccn7j6]] for self-efficacy’ brings to mind
[[uid=7xccn7j7]] constructs like mastery experience,
[[uid=7xccn7j8]] modelling, verbal persuasion,
[[uid=7xccn7j9]] physiological state. However these
[[uid=7xccn7jb]] constructs are factors that promote or
[[uid=7xccn7jc]] improve self-efficacy rather than
[[uid=7xccn7jd]] relating to ‘capacity for
[[uid=7xccn7jf]] self-efficacy’.
[[uid=7xccn7jg]] 
[[uid=7xccn7jh]] There is some relationship between
[[uid=7xccn7jj]] self-efficacy and resilience but I do
[[uid=7xccn7jk]] not think resilience ‘is the capacity
[[uid=7xccn7jl]] for self-efficacy’.
[[uid=7xccn7jm]] Self-efficacy is one factor that
[[uid=7xccn7jn]] contributes to resilience, along with
[[uid=7xccn7jp]] other cognitive and behavioral factors
[[uid=7xccn7jq]] including adaptability, optimism,
[[uid=7xccn7jr]] effective coping strategies and
[[uid=7xccn7js]] environmental factors such as social
[[uid=7xccn7jt]] support and physical and financial
[[uid=7xccn7jw]] resources.
[[uid=7xccn7jx]] 
[[uid=7xccn7jy]] This task is hard without consulting
[[uid=7xccn7jz]] resources!
