[[uid=7xj0nbkn]] 
[[uid=7xj0nbkp]] Reframing
[[uid=7xj0nbkq]] According to my analysis, is the
[[uid=7xj0nbkr]] cognitive process of changing oneâ€™s
[[uid=7xj0nbks]] perspective on a situation to alter its
[[uid=7xj0nbkt]] emotional impact. It involves
[[uid=7xj0nbkw]] deliberately shifting the
[[uid=7xj0nbkx]] interpretation of an event to reduce
[[uid=7xj0nbky]] negative emotions or foster a more
[[uid=7xj0nbkz]] positive outlook.
[[uid=7xj0nbl0]] 
[[uid=7xj0nbl1]] Exclusions
[[uid=7xj0nbl2]] Reframing does not include automatic
[[uid=7xj0nbl3]] emotional responses, personality
[[uid=7xj0nbl4]] traits, or deeply ingrained cognitive
[[uid=7xj0nbl5]] biases.
[[uid=7xj0nbl6]] 
[[uid=7xj0nbl7]] Distinctions
[[uid=7xj0nbl8]] Unlike general coping, which may
[[uid=7xj0nbl9]] involve various emotional and
[[uid=7xj0nblb]] behavioral responses, Reframing
[[uid=7xj0nblc]] specifically targets how a situation is
[[uid=7xj0nbld]] mentally appraised.
[[uid=7xj0nblf]] 
[[uid=7xj0nblg]] Dimensions
[[uid=7xj0nblh]] Reframing is a unitary construct
[[uid=7xj0nblj]] centered on cognitive change,
[[uid=7xj0nblk]] interacting with emotion regulation and
[[uid=7xj0nbll]] involving judgment and attention.
[[uid=7xj0nblm]] 
[[uid=7xj0nbln]] Related Constructs
[[uid=7xj0nblp]] It is connected to emotion regulation,
[[uid=7xj0nblq]] judgment, and mindfulness, all of which
[[uid=7xj0nblr]] support the process of shifting
[[uid=7xj0nbls]] perspectives.
