[[uid=7xh4zlp4]] Self-confidence (this one is hard to

[[uid=7xh4zlp6]] 
[[uid=7xh4zlp7]] [[taskId=definition]]
[[uid=7xh4zlp8]] 
[[uid=7xh4zlp9]] Self-confidence refers to an
[[uid=7xh4zlpb]] individual’s belief in their own
[[uid=7xh4zlpc]] abilities to handle tasks, challenges,
[[uid=7xh4zlpd]] and adversity effectively. This
[[uid=7xh4zlpf]] construct is about having a healthy
[[uid=7xh4zlpg]] sense of assurance and trust in one's
[[uid=7xh4zlph]] competencies, which contributes to a
[[uid=7xh4zlpj]] stable sense of agency and the capacity
[[uid=7xh4zlpk]] to approach problems with
[[uid=7xh4zlpl]] determination. Self-confidence involves
[[uid=7xh4zlpm]] both cognitive and emotional
[[uid=7xh4zlpn]] dimensions, where individuals maintain
[[uid=7xh4zlpp]] a positive evaluation of their skills
[[uid=7xh4zlpq]] and a resilient mindset when
[[uid=7xh4zlpr]] encountering difficulties. It is
[[uid=7xh4zlps]] associated with self-efficacy, as both
[[uid=7xh4zlpt]] constructs focus on the belief in one's
[[uid=7xh4zlpw]] ability to succeed in specific
[[uid=7xh4zlpx]] situations or tasks.
[[uid=7xh4zlpy]] 
[[uid=7xh4zlpz]] Self-confidence is a multidimensional
[[uid=7xh4zlq0]] construct, involving cognitive,
[[uid=7xh4zlq1]] emotional and behavioral components.
[[uid=7xh4zlq2]] These aspects are strongly
[[uid=7xh4zlq3]] interconnected: cognitive
[[uid=7xh4zlq4]] self-assessment facilitates emotional
[[uid=7xh4zlq5]] resilience, which in turn supports
[[uid=7xh4zlq6]] behavioral assertiveness. Together,
[[uid=7xh4zlq7]] they support and reinforce an
[[uid=7xh4zlq8]] individual’s overall sense of
[[uid=7xh4zlq9]] confidence and ability to adequately
[[uid=7xh4zlqb]] handle various situations.
[[uid=7xh4zlqc]] 
[[uid=7xh4zlqd]] Self-confidence is distinct from
[[uid=7xh4zlqf]] resilience and robustness. While
[[uid=7xh4zlqg]] resilience involves the broader
[[uid=7xh4zlqh]] capacity to recover from adversity and
[[uid=7xh4zlqj]] adapt to changes in different
[[uid=7xh4zlqk]] circumstances, self-confidence is about
[[uid=7xh4zlql]] being assured in one’s abilities
[[uid=7xh4zlqm]] without necessarily incorporating
[[uid=7xh4zlqn]] adaptability or recovery. Robustness,
[[uid=7xh4zlqp]] on the other hand, refers to the
[[uid=7xh4zlqq]] capacity to remain unchanged under
[[uid=7xh4zlqr]] stress, whereas self-confidence is
[[uid=7xh4zlqs]] about the belief that one can face and
[[uid=7xh4zlqt]] manage that stress through a belief in
[[uid=7xh4zlqw]] one’s own effectiveness.
[[uid=7xh4zlqx]] 
[[uid=7xh4zlqy]] Self-confidence involves drive and
[[uid=7xh4zlqz]] motivation, adequate coping with
[[uid=7xh4zlr0]] stress, a positive bias towards one own
[[uid=7xh4zlr1]] abilities, and an internal locus of
[[uid=7xh4zlr2]] control.
