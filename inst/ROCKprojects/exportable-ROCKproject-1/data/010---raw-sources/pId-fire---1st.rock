[[uid=7xccrwwd]] Resilience
[[uid=7xccrwwf]] 
[[uid=7xccrwwg]] [[taskId=definition]]
[[uid=7xccrwwh]] 
[[uid=7xccrwwj]] Resilience is the ability of an
[[uid=7xccrwwk]] individual to withstand adverse
[[uid=7xccrwwl]] experiences. A person can be considered
[[uid=7xccrwwm]] to have high resilience if they are
[[uid=7xccrwwn]] able to adapt to stressors, maintain
[[uid=7xccrwwp]] their balance and functionality in the
[[uid=7xccrwwq]] face of negative experiences, and stand
[[uid=7xccrwwr]] firm against adversity. The processing
[[uid=7xccrwws]] of a traumatic experience by the brain
[[uid=7xccrwwt]] and the individual's subsequent
[[uid=7xccrwww]] post-traumatic growth can be understood
[[uid=7xccrwwx]] within the framework of resilience. The
[[uid=7xccrwwy]] concept of resilience can encompass an
[[uid=7xccrwwz]] individual's healthy emotional
[[uid=7xccrwx0]] regulation skills, strong
[[uid=7xccrwx1]] self-awareness, and self-regulation
[[uid=7xccrwx2]] abilities, as well as a higher
[[uid=7xccrwx3]] perception of social support from their
[[uid=7xccrwx4]] environment. However, it is not
[[uid=7xccrwx5]] necessarily related to optimism,
[[uid=7xccrwx6]] empathy skills, or achievement
[[uid=7xccrwx7]] motivation.
[[uid=7xccrwx8]] 
[[uid=7xccrwx9]] Resilience appears to be related to
[[uid=7xccrwxb]] psychological flexibility, but
[[uid=7xccrwxc]] psychological flexibility more
[[uid=7xccrwxd]] specifically refers to the ability to
[[uid=7xccrwxf]] remain stable and adapt without
[[uid=7xccrwxg]] breaking or becoming overwhelmed in the
[[uid=7xccrwxh]] face of negative experiences. In this
[[uid=7xccrwxj]] sense, resilience can be said to
[[uid=7xccrwxk]] require a degree of psychological
[[uid=7xccrwxl]] flexibility. Resilience also appears to
[[uid=7xccrwxm]] be related to emotional resilience, but
[[uid=7xccrwxn]] emotional resilience specifically
[[uid=7xccrwxp]] refers to the ability to maintain
[[uid=7xccrwxq]] emotional stability and regulate and
[[uid=7xccrwxr]] manage one's emotions in the face of
[[uid=7xccrwxs]] negative experiences. While resilience
[[uid=7xccrwxt]] includes emotional resilience, it is
[[uid=7xccrwxw]] not limited to it; it also encompasses
[[uid=7xccrwxx]] mental fortitude. At this point, it can
[[uid=7xccrwxy]] be said that resilience has both
[[uid=7xccrwxz]] emotional and mental dimensions.
[[uid=7xccrwy0]] Resilience encompasses both emotional
[[uid=7xccrwy1]] and mental resilience. Emotional
[[uid=7xccrwy2]] resilience refers to maintaining
[[uid=7xccrwy3]] emotional balance, while mental
[[uid=7xccrwy4]] resilience signifies the ability to
[[uid=7xccrwy5]] solve and manage problems. Together,
[[uid=7xccrwy6]] they provide a strong stance against
[[uid=7xccrwy7]] challenging life events.
[[uid=7xccrwy8]] 
[[uid=7xccrwy9]] Resilience, in a sense, highlights
[[uid=7xccrwyb]] certain aspects of the human brain. For
[[uid=7xccrwyc]] example, it relates to how a person
[[uid=7xccrwyd]] processes traumatic or challenging life
[[uid=7xccrwyf]] events in their brain, their
[[uid=7xccrwyg]] perspective on these events, and how
[[uid=7xccrwyh]] these events are retained in memory
[[uid=7xccrwyj]] after processing. When a traumatic
[[uid=7xccrwyk]] event occurs, it is initially processed
[[uid=7xccrwyl]] in the brain and stored in memory. When
[[uid=7xccrwym]] faced with a similar challenging
[[uid=7xccrwyn]] situation later, the lessons learned
[[uid=7xccrwyp]] from the previous experience are
[[uid=7xccrwyq]] brought to the forefront. This allows
[[uid=7xccrwyr]] the person to use similar coping
[[uid=7xccrwys]] strategies, make decisions without
[[uid=7xccrwyt]] being distracted by the challenge,
[[uid=7xccrwyw]] effectively utilize cognitive and
[[uid=7xccrwyx]] emotional resources, evaluate the
[[uid=7xccrwyy]] situation, and choose the most
[[uid=7xccrwyz]] effective coping strategy. These
[[uid=7xccrwz0]] cognitive and emotional processes are
[[uid=7xccrwz1]] crucial components in the development
[[uid=7xccrwz2]] and maintenance of resilience.
